This is a simple means to find which classes have classinfo. 
Meaning they do DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS, DECLARE_ABSTRACT_CLASS, or
DECLARE_CLASS.

first run 
$get_classinfo /path/to/include/wx/* >classinfo

class info now contains all the classes that DO have classinfo.

then run 

../../../lua50/bin/lua classinfo.lua > noclassinfo

to get a alphabetically sorted list of classes that DON'T have
any classinfo.

This list is used to double check the %noclassinfo tags in the 
.i wrapper files. It can also be used to check for %encapsulate
since many wxObject derived classes will have classinfo, but not all
so you still have to double check for whether %encapsulate is
necessary.
