# Bastion #

Bastion is a naval rts. There are 3 goals for me :
  1. make a game, fun if possible :)
  1. start and finish a project (as you may know, starting a project is easy, finishing it is not so easy).
  1. learn more in computer science for games (graphics (Direct3D 9), path finding, multithreads, etc.).
