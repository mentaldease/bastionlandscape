This is a sample program of an embedded wxLua interpreter. This means that
wxLua is run in the same thread as the main program.

Building
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSW - Visual C
   Use the project file wxLua_wx2(x).dsw one dir up to select what you want 
   to compile. Make sure that you at least have compiled "lua" and
   "wxLuaLib_wx2(x)" first since this links to them. Or if you've already 
   compilied those just use "Embedded_wx2(x).dsp" to build this.

GTK - gcc
   Run make, be sure that wx-config is in your path.

Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embedded.cpp     -- sample "IDE" type editor
luasetup.h       -- the setup file for the embedded version
Makefile         -- gmake for gcc to compile the Embedded program (unix)
Makefile_import  -- (make -f Makefile_import) to create wxLuaWrap.cpp
wxLuaEditor.cpp  -- contains an editor, shell, console class
wxLuaEditor.h
/wxstedit dir    -- wxStyledTextControl editor with added features

As you trim down the size of wxLua, by editing luasetup.h to remove unneeded
classes, you may get warning about missing base classes. You'll want to put
them back. Unfortunately other problems can arise if you remove a class that
references in a member function of another class. If you really don't want that
class, then just rem "//" out the function that uses the missing class in the
appropriate .i file in ../Import.
