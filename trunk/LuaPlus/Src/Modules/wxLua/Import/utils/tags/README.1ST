This is a method to extract information from a ctags "tags" file.

Edit the "get_tags" file to your liking. The -R is supposed to recurse,
unfortunately it doesn't, so I append the sub dirs. You now have a file called
"tags."

>get_tags

Edit the top of "ParseTheTags.lua" to your liking. The "basePath" variable will
be stripped from the ctags header filename. The files that are part of excludeList
are not processed at all.

>lua ParseTheTags.lua > OutputFilename

You now have a file that looks close to the original headers, w/o comments, private,
protected members and what not.
