gcc_pch contains some half written files to use the gcc precompilier
to try to extract useful information from header files.

To use this stuff:

edit wx_incl.h to suit you, these are the files that will be
included and precompiled together along with anything that
the header include themselves.

Run gcc_header to create a file called wxWinInc.pch
> gcc_header wx_incl.h wxWinInc.pch

Edit the top gcc_header.lua to specify the correct files
add paths that you care about. This program will strip out
all the includes not in the variable includepaths and trim
excess whitespace. It really doesn't do too much.

> lua gcc_header.lua > Outputfilename

With all the defines gone, it's not very useful
